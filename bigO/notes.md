# Why Big O? - Who Cares?

- It's important to have precise vocabulary to talk about our code performs
- Useful for dicusssing trade-offs between different approaches
- When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find paint points in our applications 



## What Does Better Mean ? ( better code )

- Faster ?
- Less memory - intensive?
- More Readable?

All of the above but Faster / Less memory - intensive code comes at the cost of readability



##  The Problem with Time ( running a test like performance.now() or console.time())

- Different machines will record different times
- The same machine will record different times!
- For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough? 

This is where BigO notation comes in so we can talk about time without having to actually type code/ it is universal terminology



**<u>Big O is counting the number of simple operations the computer has to perform</u>**
