# Stacks and Queues

**Objectives**

- Define what a stack is
- Understand use cases for a stack
- Implement operations on a stack data structure 



## What is a Stack?

A **LIFO** data structure!

- Last in, first out
- The last element added to the stack will be the first one element from the stack



## How is it used?

Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or stack of ... anything

As you pile it up the last thing ( or the topmost thing ) is what gets removed first

**We've seen the call stack in the debugger tool's "Call Stack"**
