# https://neetcode.io/problems/string-encode-and-decode

# Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

# Please implement encode and decode

# Example 1:
# Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

# Output:["neet","code","love","you"]

# Example 2:
# Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

# Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
