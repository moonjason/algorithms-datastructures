# Recursion

is a different way to write a solution.

The other way is to write a solution in iterations and now we are learning it recursively 

### Objectives

- Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recrusive functions
- Understand the two essential components of a recursive function 
- Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems 

## What is Recursion? 

- A process (a function in our case) that calls itself 

## Why Use Recursion?

- It's used all the time 
  - JSON.parse / JSON.stringify utilize recursion often throughout browsers
  - document.getElementById and DOM traversal (especially when elements are nested )
  - Object traversal 
  - We will see it with more complex data structures when you want to traverse through graphs, trees, etc.
- Sometimes a leaner alternative to iteration
