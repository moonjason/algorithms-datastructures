# Problem Solving Approach

### General Objectives to solving problems

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms 
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer 



### What Is an Algorithm?

- A **process** or a **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task



### How do you Improve? 

- **Devise** a plan for solving problems
- **Master** common problem solving patterns 



## Problem Solving

- Understanding the Problem

  - Can I restate the problem in my own words?

  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?

  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? 

  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question. It's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? 

  - Example

    ```js
    // Write a Function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
    
    //Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    "Implement Addition"
    //What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    "ints? floats? what about a string for large numbers?"
    //What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? 
    "int? float? strings?"
    //Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough //information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question. //It's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
    // How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? 
    ```
