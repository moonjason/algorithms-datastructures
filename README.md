# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
My journey to learning algorithms and data structures in JavaScript.



Every folder is a section of material that pertains to either algorithms or data structures. Markdown text have general run down of concepts and JS files have runnable code with comments that explain tricky areas.



All my notes are from taking Colt's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass on Udemy.  [Check it out here](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
