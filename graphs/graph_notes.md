# Graphs

*Trees are a type of graph*

A data structure that represents a set of nodes and its connections

These are familiar..

- In Linked Lists, we have a graph that has nodes connected linearly 
- In trees, we had a root note, and a bunch of children that descended from that one node 

**In these types of graphs, nodes have freedom in where they connect**

## Real World Use Cases

- Social Netwroks
- Location / Mapping
  - Google Maps 
    - Nodes can be establishments
    - Roads can be connections 
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- Recommendations
  - "people also watched"
  - "you might also like"
    - You played Halo and it has a lot of nodes that share with Borderlands 3
  - "people you might know"
  - "frequently bought with"
- EVERYWHERE



Graph of Friends and their relationships with one another

*Think of LinkedIn's 1st, 2nd, 3rd connection feature*

## Compare & Contrast Different Types of Graphs

### Essential Graph Terms

- **Vertex** - A Node
- **Edge** - A connection
- **Undirected Graph**
  - No direction/polarity to the edges
  - There is no node with a one way connection
- **Directed Graph**
  - There are one way edges (connections)
- **Weighted Graph**
  - Each edge (connection) has a value attached to it
- **Unweighted**
  - No values in the edges (connections)
